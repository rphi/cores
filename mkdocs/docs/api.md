title: API
---

Cores has a robust RESTful API for accessing inventory and booking information, used both internally by AJAX
calls on the user-interface and to enable import scripts. Saying that, it isn't limited to these uses and is
fair game if you think of an extension that might be able to make use of the data in Cores.

!!! note
    The Cores API is implemented using the [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/). For
    more information on its implementation in this app please see [here](../developer_guide/#api).

Endpoints
---

Documentation for API endpoints and implementation code snippets are generated by Cores and `coreapi` on the fly and available 
at [&lt;cores instance&gt;/api/docs](../../api/docs).

You can also see a browsable version of the majority of the endpoints [&lt;cores instance&gt;/api](../../api) where 
you can craft requests in the browser.  This doesn't show a couple of the custom endpoints for ingest however.

```json
GET /api/

HTTP 200 OK
Allow: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS
Content-Type: application/json
Vary: Accept

{
    "inventory/nic": "http://cores/api/inventory/nicbyid/",
    "inventory/host": "http://cores/api/inventory/hostbyid/",
    "inventory/hdvendor": "http://cores/api/inventory/hdvendor/",
    "inventory/hosthardware": "http://cores/api/inventory/hosthardware/",
    "inventory/hosttype": "http://cores/api/inventory/hosttype/",
    "inventory/lab": "http://cores/api/inventory/lab/",
    "inventory/rack": "http://cores/api/inventory/rack/",
    "inventory/building": "http://cores/api/inventory/building/",
    "inventory/card": "http://cores/api/inventory/card/",
    "inventory/cardtype": "http://cores/api/inventory/cardtype/",
    "inventory/nicbyid": "http://cores/api/inventory/nicbyid/",
    "inventory/hostbyid": "http://cores/api/inventory/hostbyid/",
    "booking/bookable": "http://cores/api/booking/bookable/",
    "booking/booking": "http://cores/api/booking/booking/",
    "auth/users": "http://cores/api/auth/users/",
    "auth/groups": "http://cores/api/auth/groups/"
}
```

Authentication
---

By default you will be authenticated using your existing session token for Cores. This works great for the
AJAX calls in the front-end, but if you want to access the API programmatically, you will need to authenticate in.
The easiest way to do this is with token authentication.

Create a token in the Admin pages assigned to the user you want to use, and then send this in the headers
of your requests:

> "For clients to authenticate, the token key should be included in the `Authorization` HTTP header. 
> The key should be prefixed by the string literal "Token", with whitespace separating the two strings. 
> For example:
>
> `Authorization: Token 9944b09199c62bcf9418ad846dd0e4bbdfc6ee4b`"
>
> *From [DRF docs](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/authentication/#tokenauthentication)*

Otherwise you'll most probably have read only access if you are an anonymous user. To check whether you're 
authenticated, you can make a GET request to `/api/auth-test`.
